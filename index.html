            <h1>Guess the Baby, If you win you get "Something"</h1>
        <h2>Rules and Instructions</h2>
        <p>Choose your name from the Drop Down Menu and then put in your guessing in the places below.
            You may change your answers anytime before Sunday Aug 30 at which point the website will lock.
            The closest guess (Not Price is Right style, so going over is fine) wins some prize that will be decided by
            Staci's Father when he gets around to it.
            So, yeah, Free "Something"!!!</p>
            <div class="forms"></div>
            <form>
                   <input id="name" name="name" type="text" size="25" value="Your Name">
                    Note: This is your name, not what you think the baby shoud be named.
                    <input id="height" name="height" type="text" size="25" value="Height">
                    <p>Note: Since measuring babies by length instead of height is weird (they aren't a
                    piece of lumber) we are guessing the baby's height.</p>
                    <input id="gender" name="gender" type="text" size="25" value="Gender">
                    <p>Public Service Announcement: Despite Facebook having 58 Gender options, we will be sticking to 2.
                    Note: "Wiener" will be interpreted as Male</p>
                    <input id="weight" name="weight" type="text" size="25" value="Weight">
                    <p>Note: Staci was 9lbs 11oz, that is a fat baby.
                        Public Service Announcement: there are 16 ounces in a pound, so putting 7lbs 17oz will make you look silly.</p>
                    <input id="hairColor" name= hairColor type="text" size="25" value="Hair Color">
                    <p> Note: Matilda is not a color.</p>
                    <input id="dateBorn" name="dateBorn" type="text" size="25" value="Date Born">
                    <p>Note: Dinner and a movie is not a valid answer.</p>
                    <input id="timeBorn" name="timeBorn" type="text" size="25" value="Time Born">
                    <p>Note: Jurrasic Period is both an acceptable and witty answer.</p>
                    <input id="eyeColor" name="eyeColor" type="text" size="25" value="Eye Color">
                    <p>Note: If this is confusing at all, just put brown, over half of all people have bron eyes, so the ods are in your favor.</p>
