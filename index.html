        <h3>Rules and Instructions</h3>
        <p>Fill in the text boxes below with your guesses about Staci's Baby then click submit (pretty self explanatory, really). Sunday Aug 30 is the cutoff day for gueses at which point the website will lock. The closest guess (Not Price is Right style, so going over is fine) wins some prize that will be decided by Staci's Father when he gets around to it. So, yeah, free "Something" woot woot!!!</p>
